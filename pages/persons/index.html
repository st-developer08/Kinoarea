                  "Christian Charles Philip Bale (born 30 January 1974) is an
                  English actor. Known for his versatility and physical
                  transformations for his roles, he has been a leading man in
                  films of several genres. He has received various accolades,
                  including an Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards. Forbes
                  magazine ranked him as one of the highest-paid actors in 2014.
                  Born in Wales to English parents, Bale had his breakthrough
                  role at age 13 in Steven Spielberg's 1987 war film Empire of
                  the Sun. After more than a decade of performing in leading and
                  supporting roles in films, he gained wider recognition for his
                  portrayals of serial killer Patrick Bateman in the black
                  comedy American Psycho (2000) and the titular role in the
                  psychological thriller The Machinist (2004). In 2005, he
                  played superhero Batman in Batman Begins and again in The Dark
                  Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012), garnering
                  acclaim for his performance in the trilogy, which is one of
                  the highest-grossing film franchises. Bale continued in
                  starring roles in a range of films outside his work as Batman,
                  including the period drama The Prestige (2006), the action
                  film Terminator Salvation (2009), the crime drama Public
                  Enemies (2009), the epic film Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014)
                  and the superhero film Thor: Love and Thunder (2022). For his
                  portrayal of boxer Dicky Eklund in the 2010 biographical film
                  The Fighter, he won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award.
                  Further Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations came
                  for his work in the black comedy American Hustle (2013) and
                  the biographical dramedies The Big Short (2015) and Vice
                  (2018). His performances as politician Dick Cheney in Vice and
                  race car driver Ken Miles in the sports drama Ford v Ferrari
                  (2019) earned him a second win and a fifth nomination
                  respectively at the Golden Globe Awards."
